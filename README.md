# AI-Apparel-Graphic
AI Apparel Graphic overlays logos on apparel images, adjusting size, position, and angle for realism. It uses pixel-to-pixel transformations for wrinkles, HSV for color changes, KNN for classification, 'segformer-b2-fashion' for segmentation, and MediaPipe for body key points, ensuring accurate and dynamic logo placement.
